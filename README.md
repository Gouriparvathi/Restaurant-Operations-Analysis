## Introduction  
In early 2024, **Taste of the World Café** introduced a revamped, globally inspired menu to spice up customer interest and boost revenue. The café sought to understand how well the new menu was performing, which dishes were gaining traction, and what ordering patterns could be uncovered.

With customer-level ordering data and item-level menu data available, this case study explores those trends using SQL and Power BI.

## Problem Statement
Taste of the World Café wants to:

- Evaluate the performance of its updated menu
- Analyze customer ordering behavior
- Uncover insights that can inform future marketing and product decisions
The café hopes to use these findings to refine its offerings, target the right customer segments, and create seasonal marketing campaigns to reduce off-peak slumps.
